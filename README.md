# Hostgator / cPanel DNS Automizer üõ∞Ô∏è

A lightweight DNS automation tool designed to keep your A records in sync with your dynamic public IP address ‚Äî specifically for setups where you‚Äôre hosting a server locally (behind a reverse proxy) but managing your domain through **Hostgator or any cPanel-based provider**.

## üß† Why this project exists

Many hosting providers like **Hostgator** that use **cPanel** do not allow complex backend server setups (like Golang, Node.js, etc.) or give SSH/root access. So, developers often **host their actual server locally** and expose it to the internet using tools like:

- [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- [NGINX](https://nginx.org/)
- [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)

However, here's the catch:\
Your **local public IP changes frequently** (dynamic IP), and **manually updating DNS A records every time is annoying and error-prone**.

This tool solves that.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

1. **Periodically checks your public IP** (using a public IP resolver like `https://api.ipify.org`)
2. **Saves a persistent file on your machine** that stores the last known public IP, and compares it with the current public IP to detect any changes.
3. If there's a difference:
   - Logs in to your **cPanel account** (via its native HTTP interface or API)
   - **Automatically updates the A record** with the new IP for `https://yourdomain...` and `https://www.yourdomain...`.
4. Repeat ‚Äî works as a background service on your machine.

## üß™ Example Use Case

You're running:

- A **Golang API** on your local Linux, macOS, or Windows machine.
- Your domain is managed on **Hostgator** or plain cPanel.
- You expose your server via **Cloudflare Tunnel**, **NGINX**, or **Apache**.
- Your public IP changes because you're on a home/office connection.

This tool will:

- Detect the IP change.
- Automatically update your `api.example.com` A record in cPanel DNS settings.
- Ensure traffic always resolves to your live server, even if your IP changes overnight.

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements

- Any OS that supports Go (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Hostgator or any hosting provider with **cPanel DNS access**
- Domain/subdomain pointed to your cPanel account
- cPanel **API token** with DNS edit permissions

## üîê cPanel API Token (Required)

To allow this tool to update DNS records via cPanel, you'll need to create an API token:

1. Log in to your **cPanel account**.
2. Search for **Manage API Tokens** (usually under "Security").
3. Click **Create Token**.
4. Set a name (e.g., `dns-automizer`) and give it **Zone Editor (A, CNAME, etc)** permissions.
5. Copy and save the generated token securely.

You‚Äôll use this token in your `.env` config.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions (Per OS)

### üêß Linux Setup (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. **Install Golang:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go
```

2. **Clone the Project:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer.git
cd hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer

go install
```

3. **Set Up Environment Files**
Create an `.env` file on the root folder `.env file already created. create it if needed`

4. **.env Configuration**
*Location: .env*
```env
VERSION=1.2.0 #current version
INTERVAL=20

PUBLIC_IP_CHECKER="https://ipv4.icanhazip.com" #url to check public ipv4 change to your taste.
CONFIG_IP_REGISTRY_FILE="/Add/Your/Path/hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer/config/ip.cfg"
CONFIG_IP_REGISTRY_PATH="/Add/Your/Path/hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer/config"
```

5. **Adding domains and configuration**
Create a json file in the `./domains` folder. Inside the is going to be a example.txt with basic fields.
```json

{
    "domain_name" : "your_domain",
    "main_domain_url" : "your_domain.com",
    "target_domains" : ["example.your_domain.com.","www.example.your_domain.com."],
    "auth" : {
        "username" : "cpanel_username",
        "token" : "cpanel_token"
    },
    "cpanel_port" : 2083 // usually 2083 but check on DNS Zone url
}
```

6. **Create a Makefile**
```Makefile
SERVICE_NAME=dns-automizer

run:build
	@ ./bin/dns-automizer-artifact
	

build:
	@ echo --- BUILDING ARTIFACT ---
	@ go build -o ./bin/dns-automizer-artifact ./cmd/main.go
	@ echo --- ARTIFACT BUILT ---

start:
	@ sudo systemctl start $(SERVICE_NAME)

restart:
	@ sudo systemctl restart $(SERVICE_NAME)

deploy: build
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl reload $(SERVICE_NAME)
	@ echo --- SERVICE DEPLOYED AND RUNNING ---

```

8. **Create a .service File**
```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/dns-automizer.service
[Unit]
Description=Hostgator DNS Automizer
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer/bin/dns-automizer-artifact
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer/
Restart=always
user=AddYouUser #optional

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Enable and start it:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable dns-automizer
sudo systemctl start dns-automizer
```

9. **Improve Makefile for Deployment**
```bash
# make sure to be in the project folder
make deploy 
```

### üçé macOS Setup

1. **Install Go (via Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install go
```

2. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer.git
cd hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer

go install
```

3. **Set up your `.env` file and add your domains to be watch** (same as Linux)

4. **Run it manually:**
```bash
make run
```

5. *(Optional)* Create a `launchd` `.plist` file to run it as a background service.

---

### ü™ü Windows Setup

1. **Install Go:**
   - Download and install from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)

2. **Install Git Bash or use PowerShell**

3. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer.git
cd hostgator-cpanel-dns-automizer

go install
```

4. **Set up your `.env` file and add your domains to be watch** like on Linux/macOS.

5. **Run the app (from Git Bash or terminal):**
```bash
make run
```

---

### üõ† Enhancements
